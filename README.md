# Medium Bank System â€“ Santander Bootcamp 2025 (Back-End with Python)

### In this update, I implemented significant improvements and new features to make the system more secure, modular, and functional:

ðŸ”¼ **Data structure reorganization** â€“ All client information is now centralized in a single dictionary.

ðŸ”¼ **Code modularization** â€“ Refactored large functions into smaller ones, each with a specific responsibility, improving maintainability and scalability.

âž• **Monetary value formatting** â€“ All monetary values are now displayed with two decimal places to ensure consistency.

âž• **Enhanced security validations** â€“ The system now checks for duplicate logins and CPF (Brazilian ID) during user registration.

âž• **Full user registration** â€“ Includes collection of full name, CPF, and address.

âž• **Automatic login generator** â€“ Generates unique logins based on client information.

âž• **Security check system** â€“ Ensures that no duplicate accounts are created using the same login or CPF.

# Basic Bank System â€“ Santander Bootcamp 2025 (Back-End with Python)

### This is the very first version on a banking system built with Python. The features implemented are:

âž• **Basic validations**
- Rejects invalid numbers (non-numeric inputs).
- Prevents negative values in transactions.

âž• **Flow system**
- User can chose an operation, finish the operation and start another without needing to recall the project.

âž• **Limitations**
- User can only make 3 withdrawal per day.

âž• **Dictionaries**
- Bank client: with one test-account registered (vinny)
- Client statement: with all transactions made
> Note: This structure is temporary and will be improved in future updates.

âž• **Code Modularization**
- Although it was requested a basic code, I already made it with functions and an initial software structure.

### Functionalities:
ðŸ’° **Financial Operations** â€“ Make deposits or withdrawals.

ðŸ“œ **Check Bank Statement** â€“ Tracks all transactions (deposits/withdrawals).

âœ… **Check Account Balance** â€“ Includes collection of full name, CPF, and address.
